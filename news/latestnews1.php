                    <h4>Free Senior High School Programme</h4>
                    <p>On the free senior high school, he assured that President John Dramani Mahama would not cancel the programme. “He will rather review it,” he said.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Iddrisu also stated that “we will give true meaning to free, compulsory, and universal education.”</p>
